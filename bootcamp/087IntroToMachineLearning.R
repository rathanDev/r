# Machine learning automates analytical model building

# Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data
# machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights 
# without being explicitly programmed where to look

# Fraud detection, Network intrusion detection, 
# Web search results, Recommendation engines, 
# Email spam filtering



# Supervised - trained using labelled examples
#             - commonly used in applications 
#               where historical data predicts likely future events

# Unsupervised - is used against data that has no historical labels
#               Tries to find a label for us
#                   Self-organizing maps, nearest neighbour mapping, 
#                   k-means clustering, singular value decomposition
#               Used to segment text topics, recommend items and identify data outliers

# Reinforcement learning  -   often used for Robotics, gaming and navigation
#                             algorithm discovers through trial and error
#                             which actions yields the greatest rewards
#                             3 components
#                               Agent (the learner or decision maker), the environment, the actions
